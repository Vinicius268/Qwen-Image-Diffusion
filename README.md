Overview and goals
Qwen-Image-Diffusion aims to provide a robust, user-friendly way to generate high-quality images from text prompts. It combines the Qwen diffusion model with a responsive Gradio front end. The setup focuses on clarity, speed, and flexibility. You can run it on a personal machine, a workstation, or a server. The interface makes it easy to save, compare, and iterate on prompts and results.

The project centers on accessibility, repeatability, and experimentation. You can modify the prompt, adjust sampling steps, tweak guidance scales, and switch model variants to compare styles and outputs. The Gradio UI is designed to help you explore the creative space without getting bogged down in code.

What makes this project different
- Direct integration with the Qwen diffusion model, tuned for speed and quality
- A polished Gradio UI that exposes the core controls you need without overwhelming you
- Clear prompts, presets, and examples to help you start generating quickly
- An emphasis on reproducibility: fixed seeds, deterministic sampling modes, and easy saving of results
- A path to extend: the architecture is modular, so you can swap models or UI components with minimal fuss

How the system works
- Prompt parsing: The UI collects a text prompt and optional seed. The prompt is parsed and prepared for the diffusion model.
- Diffusion engine: The Qwen-based diffusion model runs a denoising process guided by the prompt. You can adjust sampling steps, guidance scale, and seed to search for different styles and levels of detail.
- Image generation: The pipeline outputs a high-resolution image. You can save the result, apply post-processing, or stash it for comparison.
- UI layer: Gradio provides a simple, responsive web interface. The UI includes fields for prompt, seed, guidance, steps, and a preview area. It also has a gallery of generated images and quick-export options.

System requirements
- A modern GPU with a minimum of 6 GB VRAM for basic usage; 12 GB or more for higher resolution outputs or fast sampling
- Python 3.10 or newer
- CUDA-enabled driver for GPUs that support CUDA for acceleration (if you plan to run on a local machine with an NVIDIA GPU)
- Adequate disk space: model weights and assets can take several gigabytes
- Reasonable memory: diffusion pipelines can be memory-hungry; ensure you have enough RAM for your chosen batch size and image resolution
- Stable internet during initial setup to fetch dependencies and model weights (or have offline resources ready)

Using the Gradio interface
- Prompt field
  - Enter a text prompt describing the scene you want
  - Combine style cues with scene descriptors, lighting, camera angles, and color palettes
- Model controls
  - Guidance scale: Higher values push the image to align with the prompt; lower values allow more creative freedom
  - Steps: The number of diffusion steps affects detail and speed
  - Seed: Reproduce exact results by fixing seeds
- Image options
  - Resolution: Choose a resolution compatible with your hardware
  - Seed mixing and tiling: Optional features to explore variations

  - Save seeds and prompts for reproducibility
  - Use prompts that specify lighting, mood, and composition to guide the model

Prompt design and examples
- Prompt structure basics
  - Subject + action + style descriptor
  - Include lighting, mood, and camera perspective for more control
- Example prompts
  - "A tranquil mountain village at dawn, ultra-detailed, watercolor, soft lighting"
  - "A cyberpunk cityscape at night, neon lights, rain, wide-angle perspective, cinematic"
  - "Portrait of a medieval warrior, oil painting, dramatic chiaroscuro, 3:4 aspect ratio"
  - "Cute fantasy creature in a grassy field, vibrant colors, high detail, 8k"
- Style modifiers
